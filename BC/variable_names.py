# Rules for variable names
# names can not start with a number
#
# names can not contain spaces, use _ intead
#
# names can not contain any of these symbols:
#
# :'",<>/?|\!@#%^&*~-+
# it's considered best practice (PEP8) that names are lowercase with underscores
#
# avoid using Python built-in keywords like list and str
#
# avoid using the single characters l (lowercase letter el), O (uppercase letter oh) and I (uppercase letter eye) as they can be confused with 1 and 0
